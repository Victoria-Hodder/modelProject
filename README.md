# modelProject

## Purpose
This is a project based on the Django Database Essentials series by PrettyPrinted. I am using it to expand my knowledge of Django models and practice testing in Python.

## Setup

I assume Python 3.x or higher is installed.

#Tech used

Built in:
```
Python 3.8.1
Django 3.0.2
```

## Features

As yet none. Watch this space!

## Getting it to run

For this project I am using `pyenv` (you can read about this here: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). For example (using linux terminal)

```
# set up a new environment
pyenv virtualenv 3.8.1 exampleenv 

# activate environment
pyenv activate nicevenv

```

In order to install all nececsary libraries please:

pip install -r requirements.txt  

Now run the app by using following command:

$ python manage.py runserver

The app should now run on your local server. To test the different endpoints, please go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/
